# Product Health Dashboard (Mockup)

This repository contains a mockup of a project I worked on during one of my internships. Due to the use of internal names and confidential information in the original project, I am unable to share the actual code or specific details. This mockup demonstrates the general structure, design, and some of the features of the original dashboard, but all data, names, and implementation details have been changed or omitted for privacy and compliance reasons.

## Features
- Dashboard table with filtering and status indicators
- Modular React component structure
- Uses [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling
- Uses [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/) for navigation and routing
- Tabbed interface for different data views (Issues, Vulnerabilities, Patching, Downtime)
- Collapsible sections and nested data organization

## Disclaimer
This code is for demonstration and portfolio purposes only. It does not represent the actual product or any proprietary information from my internship.
